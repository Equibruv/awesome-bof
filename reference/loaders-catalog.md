# Reference: BOF Loaders Catalog

This catalog summarizes known BOF (Beacon Object File) loaders and runtimes. These tools help you execute, test, or embed `.o` object files in a variety of contexts ‚Äî including inside and outside of C2 frameworks, across different platforms, and with different levels of API emulation. Each loader has its own API quirks and execution model. Always test your BOF in the target C2 to ensure compatibility.
