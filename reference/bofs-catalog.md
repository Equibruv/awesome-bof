# Reference: Public BOF Repositories Catalog

This catalog organizes public Beacon Object File (BOF) repositories into four key categories: **Toolkit Collections**, **Lists of BOFs**, **Smaller BOF Packs**, and **Other BOFs**. Use this as a quick reference to find curated toolkits, comprehensive lists, bite‚Äësized BOF bundles, or explore the broader ecosystem.


## üß∞ Toolkit Collections

These repositories contain a variety of BOFs covering multiple functions, often organized as a suite or kit.
